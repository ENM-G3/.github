- Jonas Faber: 

## 1.2. Project description
### 1.2.1. Goal 
- Elaboration of an understandable & attractive visualization of the [transformer site](https://www.transfozwevegem.be/)
  - Visualization of realtime measurements
  - Visualization of historical measurements
    - Day, week, month and year consumption
  - Additional facts / assignments for visualization
  - Linking energy and climate and financial
  - Thinking out of the box, in a fun way to appeal to young guests
    - It has to be more than just a visualization. It has to become more of an experience

### 1.2.2. Target audience
- Focus on secondary schools

## 1.3. Draft of our solution
Data visualization on a screen that has no user input.

There is no need for electronic components, because all the data is already present in a database. We will use a raspberry pi to run the frontend and backend.

The backend will be written in C#, and the frontend will be build using HTML, Javascript and CSS.
The data will be visualized using an interval where the data gets cycled. A zoomin and zoomout will be used if we need to visualize time data based on day, week, month and year.

### 1.3.1. Facts
- Compare to something else (eg. How much does it take in a year to charge your phone?)
- Fastest charger for a Tesla (150kW) (Charged in 20 min)
